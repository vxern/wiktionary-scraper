## Usage

To start using the scraper, first install it using the following command:

```shell
npm install wiktionary-scraper
```

The simplest way of using the scraper is as follows:

```ts
import * as Wiktionary from "wiktionary-scraper";

const results = await Wiktionary.get("word");
```

You can change the language of the target word by setting the `lemmaLanguage`:

```ts
import * as Wiktionary from "wiktionary-scraper";

const results = await Wiktionary.get('o', {
  lemmaLanguage: "Romanian",
});
```

You can specify if redirects should be followed by setting `followRedirects` to `true`:

```ts
import * as Wiktionary from "wiktionary-scraper";

// Redirects to and returns results for "Germany".
const results = await Wiktionary.get('germany', {
  followRedirects: true,
});
```

By default, the `User-Agent` header used in requests is filled in using a default value mentioning `wiktionary-scraper`.

To remove it, set `userAgent` to `undefined`.

If you want to change it, specify `userAgent`:

```ts
import * as Wiktionary from "wiktionary-scraper";

const results = await Wiktionary.get('word', {
  userAgent: "Your App (https://example.com)",
});
```

You can also parse HTML of the website directly, bypassing the fetch step.

ℹ️ Notice that, as opposed to `get()`, `parse()` is synchronous:

```ts
import * as Wiktionary from "wiktionary-scraper";

const results = Wiktionary.parse(html);
```

## Completeness

This library currently only supports the English version of Wiktionary.

#### Features

- Parses both single- and multiple-etymology entries.
- Recognises standard, non-standard and some explicitly disallowed parts of speech, as defined [here](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Entry_layout#Part_of_speech). In total, there are 60+ recognised parts of speech, which should cover the vast majority of definitions.
  - Note, however, that it is very possible that the library will fail to recognise certain niche, non-standard parts of speech. Should you come across any, please post an issue.
